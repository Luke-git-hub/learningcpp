I learned how to install and begin to use Vim.

First start by creating a text file
	Create a text file - vim xxxx.txt

Next notice that you are in a new editor. There are a bunch of modes but there are four main ones and 3 that I kind of understand.

The command mode which you enter when you type escape

The insert mode which you enter after pressing i (must already be in command mode)

The command line mode which you enter after pressing : (must already be in command mode)

and the Visual mode which I havent spent time with, v (must already be in command mode)

to save go into command line mode and press w

to quit go into command line mode and press q (can do together as wq)

also remember that you can compile code using the following command:
g++ -std=c++11 yourcode.cpp -o main
